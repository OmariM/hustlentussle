# UI Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of the Hustle n' Tussle web interface for documentation purposes. To update these screenshots:

## How to Take Screenshots

1. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   python web/app.py
   ```

2. **Access in browser**:
   Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

3. **Take screenshots of the following screens**:
   - **setup-screen.png**: The initial setup page with name input fields
   - **voting-screen.png**: The voting interface during a round, showing matchups, scores, and voting options
   - **results-screen.png**: The final results page showing leaderboards with medals and crown emojis

4. **Crop and optimize**:
   - Use resolution of approximately 1200x800 pixels
   - Crop to include relevant UI elements only
   - Optimize file size for web (PNG format recommended)
   - Save to this directory with the specified filenames

## Sample Data for Screenshots

For consistency in documentation, use the following sample data:

**Lead Names**:
```
John, Michael, David, James, Robert
```

**Follow Names**:
```
Emma, Olivia, Sophia, Isabella, Ava
```

**Judge Names**:
```
Alex, Jordan, Sam
```

This will create a manageable competition size with enough participants to demonstrate the crown emoji and other UI features.
