# Hustle n' Tussle - Dance Competition CLI

This is a colorful, interactive command-line interface (CLI) app to run a **partner dance competition**!

Participants are divided into **Leads** and **Follows**, with **Guest Judges** and **Contestant Judges** voting each round.
The game automatically manages voting, scoring, elimination, and final standings!
