# Hustle n' Tussle - Dance Competition Application

A comprehensive application to manage a partner dance competition between **Leads** and **Follows**. The game randomly pairs dancers, uses **Guest Judges** and **Contestant Judges** to vote each round, supports **Ties** and **No Contest**, tracks individual points, and displays final leaderboards.

Now available with both a CLI and Web interface!
